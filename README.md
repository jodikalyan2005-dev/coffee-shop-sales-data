## ðŸ”Ž Process

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned raw dataset (`date, datetime, coffee_name, cash_type, money, card`).  
- Handled **missing values** (cash transactions had no card info).  
- Converted transaction dates into **Month, Weekday, Hour** for trend analysis.  
- Removed duplicates and standardized product names.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed **sales trends over time**.  
- Identified **popular coffee types** and their revenue contribution.  
- Segmented purchases by **cash vs. card**.  
- Discovered **time-based sales patterns** (daily & hourly peaks).  

### 3. Dashboard Development
Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with:
- Bar chart â€“ Highest selling coffee types  
- Line chart â€“ Count of payment types by coffee name  
- Donut chart â€“ Sales distribution by product  
- Pie chart â€“ Cash vs. Card transactions  
- Stacked bar chart â€“ Sales count by product & payment type  
- Table â€“ Detailed transactions (coffee, payment type, revenue)
